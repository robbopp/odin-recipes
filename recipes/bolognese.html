        <li>500 g dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the garlic and onions, pick and finely chop the rosemary, then finely slice the bacon.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a splash of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the bacon, rosemary, garlic and onion and cook
            for 5
            minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until
            starting to
            brown, then pour in the wine. Leave to bubble and cook away.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, blitz to a paste, then add to the pan
            with the
            tomatoes. Stir well, break the plum tomatoes apart a little.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and giving it a stir after 30 minutes –
            if it looks
            a little dry at this stage, add a splash of water to help it along.</li>
        <li>About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water according to the packet
            instructions.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then return to the pan with a few
            spoons of
            Bolognese, a good grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of Bolognese to each, then serve with a
            fine grating
            of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
